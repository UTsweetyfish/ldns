 like the DNSSEC documents, and allows developers to easily create software
 conforming to current RFCs, and experimental software for current Internet
 Drafts.
 .
 This package contains various client programs related to DNS that are
 based on top of libldns library and DRILL tool which is similar to dig.
 These tools were designed with DNSSEC in mind and are useful for DNS
 and DNSSEC testing and debugging.
